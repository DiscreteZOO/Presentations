# *DiscreteZOO* - a repository of combinatorial objects and its companion Sage package

This talk will be held on the Software Tools For Mathematics workshop
in Koper, Slovenia, on September 28, 2018.

## Abstract

*DiscreteZOO* is a project combining a central repository of discrete objects,
its website front-end and extensions for software packages like Sage.
The repository contains certain precomputed properties
to speed up the processes of filtering, searching and computation.
For now, it can store graphs,
with the groundwork already laid out for more combinatorial objects
(such as maps, maniplexes, geometries, etc.).

In the talk we will show how one can interact with *DiscreteZOO*
on the example of the censuses of vertex-transitive graphs
by Royle, Conder, and Potočnik, Spiga & Verret.
We will perform some example searches on the website,
download a subset of the database
and showcase some queries that can be run locally with the Sage package.
